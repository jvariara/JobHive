Welcome to the repository for JobHive, a social platform for keeping track of jobs and staying connected with your peers!

## Deployment

Project is not ready for deployment, still working on the backend API endpoints.

## Tech-Stack

We used several technologies to build our application, such as:

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - JS framework used for front-end development
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Engine for the backend logic
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - Hosted the backend server using flask
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Our database for the project
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - ORM to seamlessly connect flask and database
* [BeautifulSoup4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) - Used for webscraping fresh jobs off the internet for users to see.
