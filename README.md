Welcome to the repository for JobHive, a social platform for keeping track of jobs and staying connected with your peers!

## Deployment

Project is not ready for deployment, still working on the backend API endpoints.

## Tech-Stack

We used several technologies to build our application, such as:

    [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - JS framework used for front-end development
    [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Engine for the backend logic
    [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - Hosted the backend server using flask
    [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Our database for the project
    [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - ORM to seamlessly connect flask and database
    [BeautifulSoup4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) - Used for webscraping fresh jobs off the internet for users to see.
